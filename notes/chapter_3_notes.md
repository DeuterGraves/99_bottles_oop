# 3: Unearthing Concepts

## 3.1 Listening to Change

>Most cost-effective code is as good as necessary - no better

chosing to refactor now rather than later may cost opportunities (working on other problems)

new requirements tell you:
* exactly how the code should change - no need to speculate about the future
* imposes higher standards on affected code - code that needs to be change must be changeable

### 99 Bottles New Requirement!!!

* feature request: output "1 six-pack" any time it currently says "6 bottles"
  * *NB:* this is specific to "1 six-pack"
  * not multiples of six packs
  * "1 six-pack"
  * do not read further into requirements or try to predict the future.

Clarify requirements

Write the minimum necessary code (this actually leaves your code more flexible for the future than trying to make it flexible before you know how it needs to flex)
