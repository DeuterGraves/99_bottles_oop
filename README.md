# 99 Bottles

I'm working through the 99 Bottles of OOP Ruby version by Sandi Metz.

Taking [notes](/code_along_notes.md) as I read and code along.

## Installing Ruby

### Windows

There's an installer, it's easy.
http://rubyinstaller.org/

### Mac

Newer macs ship with a usable version of Ruby.

Try `ruby -v` in a terminal window, and if it's 1.9.x or 2.x you're fine.
